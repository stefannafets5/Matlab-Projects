## Overview

This project is divided into three main tasks, each focusing on different computational topics:

- **Numerical Music Processing:** Implementations related to audio signal processing, including stereo-to-mono conversion, spectrogram generation, signal oscillators, low-pass filtering, and reverb effects.

- **Polynomial Interpolation with Vandermonde Matrices:** Reading data, constructing Vandermonde matrices, and computing polynomial interpolation for given data points.

- **Recommendation System:** Processing user-item matrices, filtering data, computing similarity metrics, and generating recommendations based on matrix factorization.

## Task 1 - Numerical Music Processing

- **stereo_to_mono:**  
  Converts a stereo audio signal to mono by averaging the two channels and normalizing the result.

- **spectrogram:**  
  Computes the spectrogram of a signal by applying windowed FFTs with a Hanning window and returning the magnitude spectrum along with time and frequency vectors.

- **oscillator:**  
  Generates a synthesized audio signal using sine waves and linear interpolation between sample points.

- **low_pass:**  
  Applies a low-pass filter by performing a Fourier transform on the input signal, zeroing out frequencies above a cutoff, and then applying the inverse transform and normalization.

- **apply_reverb:**  
  Simulates reverberation by convolving an impulse response (converted to mono) with the input signal and normalizing the output.

## Task 2 - Polynomial Interpolation (Robotzii)

- **parse_data:**  
  Reads input data from a file, extracting points needed for interpolation.

- **vandermonde:**  
  Constructs the Vandermonde matrix for the given data and solves the linear system to find polynomial coefficients.

- **P_vandermonde:**  
  Evaluates the interpolating polynomial at specified points using the calculated coefficients.

---

## Task 3 - Recommendations

- **read_mat:**  
  Reads a CSV matrix of user-item interactions, ignoring headers.

- **preprocess:**  
  Filters out rows (users/items) with fewer than a minimum number of reviews to ensure data quality.

- **cosine_similarity:**  
  Calculates the cosine similarity between vectors, useful for measuring similarity between users or items.

- **recommendations:**  
  Performs matrix factorization using singular value decomposition (SVD) and returns ranked recommendations based on similarity scores.

## Implementation Notes

- All tasks use built-in Octave functions such as `fft`, `hanning`, `vander`, `svds`, and `norm` for efficient computation.

- Data normalization and vector/matrix manipulations ensure numerical stability and meaningful results.

- The code is modular, with each function focusing on a specific aspect of the task to improve readability and maintainability.

## How to Use

Each task folder contains a set of functions and test scripts demonstrating their usage. To run the project:

1. Navigate to the task folder (e.g., `task1_numerical_music`).

2. Call the main functions with appropriate parameters as documented in the function headers.

3. Review outputs such as plots, matrices, or recommendation lists generated by the code.
